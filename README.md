Agriculture development in India: a study on progress, performance and determinants.

Here we have made an econometric model which has analysed the available data (1993 - 2016) of agricultural credit, land, rain, employment with the total agricultural output. This model will show us the econometric analysis and statistical relevances of the selected factors with the total agricultural production every year. In the conclusion, we can see how these factors are impacting the overall agricultural prodection.

In the report file, there are five sections: Section I provides a brief literature review. Section II provides the data used for the analysis. Section III states the econometric methodology used in the analysis with some descriptive data. Section IV presents the results of the empirical analysis. Section V concludes the paper.
